Welcome to my journey through the VSD's RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program! This repository serves as a living document, chronicling my week-by-week progress, key learnings, and hands-on experience in designing a full System-on-Chip from the ground up.

> "In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."

**My Design Journey:** `📝 RTL Design` → `🔄 Synthesis` → `🏗️ Physical Design` → `🎯 Tapeout Ready`
